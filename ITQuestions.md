Q: What is a namespace?
A: Allows for names to be separated from one another, more organized
Q: What are value types?
A: Value types contain data that is stored in the program
Q: What are reference types?
A: Reference types allows the program to reference a value type and use it.
Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
A: No additional logic for something to work, keeps it simple.
Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
A: Less lengthy code, allows programmer to easily get access to something.
Q: What are dynamic type variables?
A: Dynamic type variables are able to change/are mutable
Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
A: Is operator tests something
Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
A: Define specification of a data type in a class or method until it is used.
Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
A: The scope for a public member of a class can be used anywhere in the program (?)
Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
A: Yes, I believe so.
Q: How do you sort an array?
A: Array.Sort(Array)
Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
A: Represents a normal range of values for its underlying value type, plus a null value.
Q: What is an enumeration?
A: Defines a constant set of values.
Q: What is inheritance?
A: Uses previous code in a new statement.
Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
A: Yup.
Q: What is the purpose of as operator
A: Sets a variable to a certain type (as string)
Q: What is an object?
A: An object is a blueprint for what that type will do.
Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
A: Struct = Value type, Class = reference type
Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
A: continue allows the loop to keep going, break stops the loop
Q: What is this and how is it used?
A: Can be used to continue loops (keep it going) or stop a loop.
Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
A: Try = Allows the loop to try something unless it catches an error
A2: Catch = Allows a loop to catch an exception and successfully handle it without a crash.
Q: How is exception handling done?
A: Catches a exception and does something else if an error occurs (doesn't allow program to crash)
Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
A: The last part of the loop, finishes the loop.
Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
A: Array = Cannot be changed, set in stone
A2: ArrayList = Can be changed, in a list format.
Q: What is an object?
A: An object is a blueprint for what that type will do.
Q: Define constructor.
A: Assembles statements together.
Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
A: A name given to data type.
Q: What is an abstract class?
A: Creates classes that are incomplete and must be from a derived class
Q: What is an interface?
A: Lets functions from different classes through the same interface reference
Q: What is a method?
A: Code block containing a series of statements
Q: What is a property?
A: Provides a easy way to read or write the value of a private variable
Q: What is an access specifier?
A: Defines scope of a class member
Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
A: Private, Public = If they can be used throughout the program or not.
Q: What is a collection?
A: Provide support for stacks, queues, lists, and hash tables
Q: What is a Hash Table?
A: Hash tables are used when you need to access certain elements.
